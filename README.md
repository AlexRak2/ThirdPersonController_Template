# ThirdPersonController_Template

# I created this template around a year ago to try and recreate Unreals Advanced Locomotion Asset
# I spent a week on this and never got back to it so i decided to give it out for free.

# There will most likely be bugs as i never finished it. I believe its a good starter point with some easy non complex code to continue off

# if you have any questions feel free to join my discord and ask me! https://discord.com/invite/vB2NCBN44r
