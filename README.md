#ThirdPersonController_Template

#Description:

This template was created approximately a year ago with the aim of recreating Unreal's Advanced Locomotion Asset. While I invested a week in its development, I never had the chance to finish it. As a result, I've decided to release it for free, in the hope that it can serve as a valuable starting point with straightforward, non-complex code for your own projects.

Please Note:

There may be existing bugs in this template since it was never fully completed.
This template is intended as a foundation for your project, and you are encouraged to build upon it.
